# Introduction

* Using consolidated set of libraries makes codebase consistent and knowledge of the team concentrated
* Sometimes it makes sense to use 2 different libraries for the same thing
  - Example: EF could be the default choice for working with SQL DB, combined with ADO.NET for specific use cases

[Autofac](https://autofac.org/) - the most popular DI container

[Serilog](https://serilog.net/)

[NLog](https://github.com/NLog/NLog)

[NUnit](https://nunit.org/) - has better documentation than xUnit

[FluentAssertions](https://fluentassertions.com/) - most widely used assertion library

[OpenTelemetry specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification)

[OpenTelemetry .NET](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet)

[OpenTelemetry .NET contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-contrib)

[Health checks](https://github.com/Xabaril/AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks) - a very extensive list

[FluentValidation](https://docs.fluentvalidation.net/) - more extensible than DataAnnotations

[Fody](https://github.com/Fody/Fody) - weaver for .NET assemblies

[IdGen](https://github.com/RobThree/IdGen) - Snowflake ID generator
